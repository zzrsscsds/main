What's the point of having people guess your body fat? Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.

So let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:

1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.
2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and

Let's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.).

Protein Science Updated: Why It’s Time to Move Beyond the “1.6-2.2g/kg” Rule,1311,191,2025-01-07 16:42:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1hvvls5/protein_science_updated_why_its_time_to_move/,"#Link to article:  https://www.strongerbyscience.com/protein-science/

The latest article from Greg Nuckols explores the current protein recommendations and dissects the available data to suggest that a higher intake may be necessary to fully maximize muscle gains.  From the introductory paragraph:

>The recommendation that lifters should aim to consume “1.6-2.2g/kg” [0.73-1.0g/lb] of protein is almost universally taken to be an unquestionable truth. You probably don’t need to exceed 1.6g/kg in the first place, and if you do exceed 2.2g/kg, you’ll definitely just waste the extra protein you consume – it certainly won’t contribute to further muscle growth. However, a closer look at the meta-analysis that generated this recommendation suggests that we probably shouldn’t have been quite so confident that protein intakes within this range will maximize muscle growth. When you dive deep into the protein research, it looks like slightly higher intakes may be necessary to max out your gains.

This article is a deep and nerdy dive into the data, with calibrative cross references into even more data.  It concludes with practical takeaways, including advice on [how to scale the recommendation](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-18-at-11.53.16%E2%80%AFAM-2048x1300.png) by gender and body composition.",Fitness

"2,000 Workouts Without a Rest Day",590,137,2024-10-16 17:08:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1g54ik2/2000_workouts_without_a_rest_day/,"This is another update about training without rest days. I have surpassed 2,000 consecutive training days. Along the way I have grown bigger, stronger, and generally more fit. This is because training without rest days requires sustainability above all else. To accomplish that, my priorities as a lifter have shifted to consistency, patience, and effort. These are what I have previously referred to as “[the triumvirate of progress](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/).” Those three priorities govern sustainable progress, meaning gains.

**What this post is not…**

… me saying that rest days are wholly or even generally unwarranted.

… me saying that rest days are bad, suboptimal, unscientific, etc.

… me making a moral or ethical argument about rest days themselves.

… me trying to make you feel bad for taking rest days.  

**This post is…**

… an anecdote about training without rest days and how daily training has benefitted me.

**Stats**

Age: 38.7

Gender: Man(let)

Weight: 210

Height: LOL

Lifts: Squat [525](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0KGr8rAkAY/?img_index=1), Bench [340](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuSzsrhgtCx/), Dead [600](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4qKfzxAq9K/) (best ever was 635), Press [250](https://www.instagram.com/p/Czw7oYDAwKT/?img_index=2).

Natty Status: I was on TRT nearly a decade ago. Tried it for a year. Didn’t benefit from it like I thought I would based on what I was told at the time. Nothing during this period. I have not and do not claim to be a “lifetime natural.”

**Why I decided to start training daily (and heaps of other detailed information)**

That and more can be read in my previous posts:

[Five Years Without a Rest Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1bob6rg/five_years_without_a_rest_day/)

[The Tom Platz Experience: Pain, pleasure, and high rep squats](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1953k9l/the_tom_platz_experience_pain_pleasure_and_high/)

[Four Years Without a Rest Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/12lgk9f/four_years_without_a_rest_day/)

[No Rest Days](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/yaw8qa/no_rest_days/)

[1,000 Workouts Without a Rest Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/sb7tbh/1000_workouts_without_a_rest_day/)

**Training without rest days has benefited me because:**

**-** By prioritizing sustainability over all else, I make better training decisions. This results in fewer injuries and minor setbacks, meaning more gains with less risk.

**-** [Lifting is something I enjoy, so I do it often and feel better because of it.](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2023/04/physicality-creativity-and-consciousness.html)

**-** Frequency is a significant factor in making progress, whether that is gaining size or strength. I am now bigger than I’ve ever been and stronger in nearly every lift.

**-** My general fitness has improved due to the increased training frequency allowing for more training diversity. Meaning more opportunities to include conditioning workouts whereas previously nearly all my workouts were strength oriented because “I didn’t have time to do conditioning” consistently (an excuse).

You might benefit similarly if you decide to train without rest days. You might not. All I can say definitively is that I am happy with my results and because training is itself a luxury and a pleasurable experience, I will continue to do it daily.

Counterintuitively, busier people seem to do better with daily training. This is because a three-, four-, or five-day training week (as is typical) packs in exercises and a progression that can take an hour or more to complete. Busy people often do not have that kind of time. I have found that my busy clients can manage 30 to 45 minutes consistently and sometimes even less than that. So, to accomplish their goals they have started training daily, with each workout being shorter, biasing the program towards consistency, which ushers results when coupled with patience, effort, and of course sensible exercise selection, volume, and intensity progression.

While most of my training has been based on my [General Gainz training framework](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/), there are occasions when my progress is not derived from General Gainz, or even my own [original training structure](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-gzcl-method-simplified_13.html) (modeled after a pyramid). These resources will provide to you a reasonable structure with which you can build your own training programs. Even brief ones, so that you can also begin training daily (if it is right for you; some may have contraindications).

There are two things that have recently benefitted my training. The first was when I ran a program called Maelstrom which resulted in a lifetime personal record [600-pound beltless deadlift](https://youtu.be/q0_bACQ8MvI?si=YjLVb1mWvqcaiBps). Here is [a review another user wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/1cy1oq2/upcoming_program_review_gzcl_maelstrom_for/) of their experience running that program. This was a very unusual approach to training the deadlift because it is high frequency, high volume, and low intensity.

The second occasion was when I had only a brief period to get a training session in. This happens somewhat regularly now because I own my own business. To train effectively in a short period of time I would do workouts that I began to call Monotony. These helped me maintain the daily training streak because even if I had only 15 minutes in my schedule, I could still hammer a lift and benefit from the workout. Perhaps you would likewise benefit.

You can read [Maelstrom & Monotony](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2024/10/2000-days-maelstrom-monotony.html) and watch me perform those workouts on my blog and Instagram. On my blog you will have access to an updated program compendium, so that way you can perhaps run one of my old programs like GZCLP, Jacked & Tan 2.0, or try drowning in deadlifts by running Maelstrom.

I wish you the best with your training. If you have any questions, drop them in the comments and I’ll do my best to answer them.",Fitness

42 Male Cancer Survivor 8 Months Progress ,431,58,2024-08-04 14:48:24,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1ejwyxa/42_male_cancer_survivor_8_months_progress/,"Start: 190lbs 8 Months: 154lbs

Around 3 Years ago in the summer of 21 I was diagnosed with stage 4b rectal cancer. I was 39.

Underwent 2 years of treatment which included radiation, chemo and 4 Surgeries. I had my 4th and hopefully final surgery in Sep of 23, I am currently in remission.

I used to workout in my 20's but lost track of my fitness and allowed myself to reach 36 waist size.

  
**Progress Pics:**

I don't know why i took this pic but this is me post covid, i probably weighed like 220+ at this stage

[https://imgur.com/a/ronPlvk](https://imgur.com/a/ronPlvk)

This is me in Feb of 24 - [https://imgur.com/a/u9b3FA1](https://imgur.com/a/u9b3FA1)

This Pic is from July 6th - [https://imgur.com/a/eK61dsX](https://imgur.com/a/eK61dsX)

I just wanted to help my body heal and repair the damage from the 2 years of treatment and made a commitment to myself to try and do some workout and hopefully make it a habit.

**Diet:**

**Dec - Feb:** The most important change was my diet, I was asked by my surgeon to start taking a high protein and as low carbs as you can diet to try and combat some post radiation issues in my GI tract.

I did intermittent fasting for 16 hours from 7pm - 11am

First Meal - Chicken/Fish , Sauté vegetables(more colors the better), 1 Bowl Fruit

Second Meal - Greek Yogurt With Handful of Almonds, 2 Ripe Banana's

Third Meal - Grilled Chicken/Baked Salmon, 2 Slice Sourdough Bread



**Feb - Current** : I stopped doing intermittent fasting and added a whey isolate protein shake. I target to eat my third meal before 7:30 pm each night

Right After Workout - Whey Isolate Protein Shake, Overnight Soaked Almonds

First Meal - 2 Whole Boiled Eggs, 2 Whole Boiled Egg white only, Greek Yogurt/Cottage Cheese

Second Meal - Chicken/Fish , Sauté vegetables(more colors the better), 1 Bowl Fruit

Around 3-4pm - Whey Isolate Protein Shake

Third Meal - Grilled Chicken/Baked Salmon, half cup or full cup of wild/brown rice.

**Exercise Routine:** 

I started with r/bodyweightfitness  minimal routine and a self made warmup routine in the third week of Dec 23. Following was the routine

Warm-up

All of these were done for 30sec - 1 min

Seiza

Deep Squat And Hold

Bear Walk

Crab

Horse Stance

Dead Hang

Minimal Routine

I did this like a circuit on an average i did 4 per day

Push Up

Squat(bodyweight)

Low Row(Two Bedsheets in a door)

Plank

Jumping jacks

I did this routine with a goal to be able to do 10 push ups 20 squats 10 low row 1 minute plank 35 jumping jacks.

Around Feb of 24 I started noticing some changes in day to day energy levels and it just felt good and my post radiation issues were also easing down.

I was not able to go to gym yet since i was still dealing with a lot of post treatment issues and i wanted to be able to challenge myself without needing to buy weights as I live in an appt.

Did some research and bought a cheap squat rack from amazon and a pair of gymnastics rings, parallettes, a set of resistance bands. The squat rack was for hanging the rings and getting a bar to do pull ups.

I went with a modified version of the beginner routine from r/bodyweightfitness wiki the warmup routine remained the same except i removed the dead hang.

All Pairs in Supersets with a 90 sec rest in the pair and 60 sec rest for the core superset pairs.

3 sets - rep number changed throughout, the below numbers are what i am doing currently

Pull Up - 5

Squats(Bands) - 10



Ring Dips - 8

Ring Hamstring curls - 15



Ring Inverted Rows - 8

Decline Push Up(parallettes) - 10



Core Superset

Hanging Knee Raises - 10

Palof Press - 10 each side

Superman - 10



I now have access to a gym and was wondering what would be a good program to start my goal is to build strength and get down to 14-18 % body fat range.

I was looking at the 5/3/1 for beginner and liked this following routine

Day 1:

– Superset Bench with: DB Row, Planks

– Superset Squat with: DB OHP, BW Bulgarian Split Squat

Day 2:

– Supserset OHP with: DB Curls, Paloff Press with Band

– Superset DL with: Pushups, DB Lunges

Day 3:

– Superset Squat with: DB Rows, DB Swings

– Superset Bench with: DB Lateral Raises, Leg Raises (on bench)

a set of  main lift, a set of both accessories, then rest 90s.

I plan to swim for 30 mins on rest days

Thanks for going through the post, I hope you can find something useful here to start your own journey.",Fitness

"Ultrarunning and Strength Training - Racing 100 miles while Benching 405+ & Deadlifting 600+ - My take on ""Hybrid Training"", and how to get started if you want to lift heavy AND run extreme distances.",467,64,2024-04-29 15:23:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1cg1ufj/ultrarunning_and_strength_training_racing_100/,"It used to be, that there were strength athletes, and then there were endurance athletes. With very little overlap in disciplines. Obviously, there were people in sports doing both, but they generally specialized in one, and only dabbled in the other sporadically. 

These days social media is absolutely inundated with *“Hybrid athletes”;* men and women who see themselves, not just as a runner, or cyclist, or powerlifter, or bodybuilder, but as a combination of 2+, wildly incongruent, disciplines.

These *“Hybrid Athletes”* often fill their social media with messages about how you can become strong, and fast, and that you do not have to choose between one or the other, as long as you *“Just buy their program and products!”* 

Well today, I would like to share some of my thoughts on *“*hybrid training*”.* But before we get into the thick of it, a quick TLDR for those of you not interested in reading the whole post is below.

***TLDR:*** ***“Hybrid Training”*** **isn’t going to make you an elite athlete. You likely won’t be setting any records in either of your chosen sports if you go this route. You might get quite good at one, and proficient at the other, or if you are very gifted, maybe you will get really good at both, but you will never be ELITE;** ***(setting national+ records in both sports simultaneously),*** **at two sports that require incredibly different training methodologies and favor opposing body types. The online influencers and** ***“coaches”*** **do not have a magic formula to get you fast and jacked. The truth is that** ***""hybrid training""*** ***WILL*** **give you worse results than focusing on one sport, however, the variety can be very rewarding. How you go about this is all very simple, it’s just also incredibly time consuming.**

(note: I really hate the term “**hybrid athlete**” and do not consider myself to be an ""athlete"" at all, I am just a working father and husband that enjoys running and lifting. So from this point on in the post, I will be avoiding it)

#**Who am I? (i.e. “credentials”)**

Some of you may recognize me from previous posts, such as:

· **OVERTRAINED: Deadlift** – Where [I deadlifted 605+ every day for 50 days, ending in a 765lb 1rm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/s/qpgVJVl6Jb)

Or

· **OVERTRAINED: Bench** – Where [I Benched 345+ every day for 50 days, ending in a 465lb 1rm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/s/vTeEmUufnR)

I have also created and shared a few popular programs over the years, which have helped many of you on your strength goals.

More recently, I ran 100 miles through the rain and mud, at the Rocky Raccoon 100, in Huntsville Texas. A race that saw over half the field drop out due to the horrible trail conditions. Despite the rain, flooded trails, mud, and slop, which resulted in macerated feet, blisters, and losing toenails, I pushed through and made it to the end.

Then, just 3 days later… I [loaded up 4 plates on the bar, and hit a 405 lb bench press](https://www.reddit.com/r/GYM/s/dFt3M7E7dh). A combination of achievements that has rarely *(*if ever?*)* before been achieved.

I spent the subsequent 10 weeks following the race hitting consistent 70-100+ mile weeks, while lifting 2-3x per week, leading up to this friday, where I [Deadlifted 617 pounds, and then immediately began a 63 mile run through the night](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/s/ZW5Xl5Snpz) another fun mix of heavy lifting and long distance, this time, done as a solo event with my 3 year old Australian Shepherd.

***A bit more background & some Notable PR’s***

I started ice-skating at just 3 years old, played hockey, baseball, football, worked on a farm, hunted, and was generally extremely active throughout my entire childhood. At the age of 12 I began lifting in the gym with my dad, and he taught me all the basics of barbell training. I also stayed involved in sports, and competed as a varsity athlete until going off to college. I am a registered professional engineer, and own/operate a business, while raising a young family of 3 children with my wife, who I have been with for nearly 18 years. After 20+ total years of training, I reached my peak lifting numbers in 2021, when I competed in a powerlifting meet, and set the deadlift record for my state, with a 716lb lift. After the competition I made a drastic shift over to running as my main priority, and signed up for my first ultramarathon. A 50 kilometer trail race in central Minnesota. 


I set all my Personal Records in lifting and running between September 2021 and the present day, a period of 2.5 years. Those PR’s were:

· 606 squat

· 465 bench

· 765 sumo deadlift / 700 conventional / 716 State Record Deadlift.

· 5:10 Mile

· 18:34 5k

· 3:18 Marathon

· Completed at least a marathon and/or an ultramarathon every month for going on 2+ years, with distances up to 100 miles.

All of these can be found in my extensive post history here on reddit.

---

So, after that first 50k trail ultramarathon, I was hooked. I signed up for a 100k, and started running 50-100+ mile weeks.

In 2023 I logged 3465 miles, with long runs extending beyond the marathon distance of 26.2 miles, up to 50+ miles, at least once per month. Some were sanctioned races, some were solo adventures, but they all pushed me closer to my goal, Running 100 miles at the Rocky Raccoon 100, in February 2024, which I finished just 12 weeks ago.

Rocky Raccoon was an incredibly difficult race, primarily due to the rain and mud, but it just fueled my desire for more, and I am already signed up for my next 100 miler, coming up in August of this year, with some solo ultra-adventures in between, and my first 200 miler in 2025.

I am also back to lifting heavy, having squatted 445, benched 405, and deadlifted 635 in the weeks following the race.

So that’s enough about me, lets get to the main point of this post.

***A little motivation: [“Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger - Daft Punk”](https://youtu.be/gAjR4\_CbPpQ?si=TD5S9F3UuGVyhdww)***

Over the last few years I have written quite a bit on reddit about how I go about my training, to be able to consistently finish ultramarathons, while maintaining enough strength to deadlift 600+ or bench 400+.

If you spend enough time in my post history, I am certain that you will find some very contradictory opinions on training philosophies, diet, recovery etc. This has all been a long learning process for me, as I have experimented and manipulated all the variables in my life to maximize performance in two sports that don’t typically mix very well, all while leading a busy home and work life.

So lets discuss the logistics of training.

· How hard is it to train for an ultramarathon while maintaining enough strength to bench press over 405 pounds, or deadlift 600+? 

· How hard should individual training sessions be to facilitate productive adaptations, without impacting recovery? 

· How hard is it to stick to a diet that can support all of this training? 

· How hard is it to coordinate all the training with a busy work and family life?

When I talk about how ""hard"" something is, I want to clarify that this isn’t a David Goggins style speech on “Staying Hard”. That isn’t my style at all, there are days you will need to dial things back, and there are far more important things in my life than training. Instead, its just a straightforward discussion of the facts around training to run, and lift, at a decent level, and the difficulties one must deal with if they want to succeed. As always, family and work come first, but when those aspects are properly taken care of, its time to train.

&#x200B;

These days, training to reach the top in any activity requires an absolute focus and specialization. You don’t become an elite 5k runner by improving your deadlift. You don’t become a Chess grandmaster by spending time out on the driving range working on your tee shot, and you don’t become an elite skier by playing video games. You need to put all of your free time and energy into your chosen sport/activity. This isn’t any different for strength/endurance “*hybrid*” athletes looking to get faster and stronger. 

The problem is, that is the essence of training for strength and endurance simultaneously. You are taking time away from one activity to train another, that has very little, if any, applicable carryover.

***If you are just starting out, you can do both, and you can improve at both, and you can do so for a very long time. Most of the people in this subreddit will fall into this category, and should leave this post knowing that they can run and lift and make gains, and that they don’t need to worry about [“the interference effect”](https://www.strongerbyscience.com/research-spotlight-interference-effect**)

**Lift weights, do your cardio, and get better**

&#x200B;

But for those of you striving for more, those of you who want to be the best of the best at what you do, eventually, one activity **MUST** give way for the other. 

I have fought this realization for the last 2-3 years, trying to maintain as much strength as possible while getting faster and building my endurance, but I have reached, at least my personal, genetic and time limitations. I can no longer keep pushing and building at both, and therefore I have decided to back off the heavy strength training, to make way for more running improvements. I am cutting weight, and knowingly getting weaker on the main lifts, but the tradeoff is clear. I’m getting faster even at nearly 37 years old, and my ability to endure long distances has improved drastically.

So why does this happen? Why do we hit a point where we can no longer improve? Does running interfere with muscle gain that much? 

Honestly, while that is part of the equation, I do not believe that it is the main issue. In my opinion, the biggest hurdle when it comes to training for ultras and high level strength training?... **IS TIME.**

Let’s break down my week as an example: I am running a MINIMUM of 70 miles per week right now. I have been doing so for 10 consecutive weeks, since the Rocky Raccoon 100, and plan to continue doing so all year. I have hit multiple weeks of 80+, 90+, and even 100+ miles since then. This amount of running takes a lot of time.

If you average 8:00/mi, a 75 mile week takes 10 hours. At 10:00 mile, you are looking at over 12 hours. Throw in some trail runs and hiking in the mountains, and suddenly you could be looking at 15-16+ hours just for the running alone. 

Now you want to add in 40-50+ hours per week of work, plus commute time, 50-60+ hours per week of sleep, time for meals, time for chores and a multitude of additional life obligations, and still make time for your family, going to soccer practices and piano recitals, math club, and family game night… and the remaining time for going to the gym starts to really get slim.

So do you go get that additional 8 mile run in on a Saturday afternoon? Or do you try to deadlift on fatigued legs… or do you watch Bluey with your daughter? you must decide on your own, but no matter which choice you make, it comes at the expense of all the other things.

Because of this, my training schedule includes a LOT of doubles. 

I wake up early, while my wife and kids are still sleeping, and I run 5-10 miles.

Then, later in the day, I either go to the gym during my lunch break, or I run again.

Monday through Thursday, in just 4 days, I am generally logging 8 training sessions, but they are all on MY time, when they wont interfere with my family or work obligations.

These doubles, come at the cost of sleep, and  training instead of resting/recovering at lunch. I wake up at 4:00am, and I’m busy until my head hits the pillow, after my kids are tucked in. For many people, this is not a sustainable choice to make. For me, I love it. It gives me structure and purpose outside of everyday life.

On that topic of fatigue, when you are pairing your lifting and running together, a major area of concern is going to be **how to structure your training**, so that it can be productive. I will go into this later in more detail, but its important to note, that for this type of training to work, you NEED to know how to take an easy day, while still getting work done. Note, I didn’t say a REST day, I said an EASY day. There is a big difference, and with time limitations already being an issue, you need to train as often as you have time.

**Another key aspect to fatigue management, is diet**. Everyone has their own opinions on diets, and some people are incredibly militant about them, so I am not going to spend too much time on it, but I will say this.

Carbohydrates **WILL** improve your performance. Go ahead and be low carb/keto if that’s what you want, but just know that you are adding an artificial handicap to your training.

* If you aren’t recovering between sessions: eat and sleep more. 
* If you are sore: eat and sleep more
* If you are tired before a workout: you need to eat and sleep more

Food fuels your training, and along with sleep, facilitates your recovery. If you are low on energy, you will not be productive in the gym or in your running.

I use an app called “Macrofactor” to track my weight and caloric intake, and with my weekly mileage and lifting factored into things, I require a bit over 4,800 calories per day, just to maintain my bodyweight.

&#x200B;

\---

***So what does my training look like? What should your training look like?***

Coming off of the Rocky Raccoon 100 mile race, and training leading up to my next 100, I am aiming to run a MINIMUM of 70 miles per week, with most weeks closer to 80, and peak weeks exceeding 100 miles, while lifting at least 2 times per week.

[On a day by day basis, that looks something like this.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qf\_Fx3T1tDraqlgImbtd9q1vZd3eSgeA/edit?usp=drive\_link&ouid=105219797917450253924&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Monday-Thursday all include doubles, with easy morning runs, and then lifting, or running again in the afternoon.

Fridays are recovery days, where I usually cycle, but also occasionally add more miles in with my wife or kids if they want to go for a run.

Saturdays are long run days

Sundays are more open, to fill in missing mileage, lifting, or just resting if I have completed my goal weekly distance and lifting.

If you look closely at the Weekly Schedule, you will see that I am trying to **seperate hard efforts** **by as many hours as possible,** with the exception of Thursday, which has 2x hard efforts.

The reason for this separation needs explanation. 

When getting advice from a running coach, they will tell you to do your hard running workouts first, and any heavy lifting later that day, but to keep your hard days hard, and your easy days easy.

When getting advice from a strength coach, they will tell you to do your hard lifting first, and any HIIT/interval work after, and once again, to keep your hard days hard, and your easy days easy.

The reason they suggest this, is because they care first and foremost about getting the maximum stimulus and adaptation from the first workout, when you are fresh and rested. The second workout is guaranteed to suffer. But you keep it on the same day, so that you allow enough rest time before the next hard effort of a primary workout. 

So if you are a runner, you don’t want to run hard Monday, squat hard Tuesday, and run hard Wednesday. That leaves very little time for recovery. And the same goes for someone only interested in strength training.

**However!** If you care about improving both equally, this is a recipe for failure. Over the years, the solution I have come up with, is to reduce the VOLUME of hard efforts, but to do them on their own days. This way each individual session doesn’t destroy you, it doesn’t take as long to recover from, but you can do both types of training more often. 

---

So what does “reducing the volume of hard efforts” look like? well, lets start with running for our example. Lets say you are running a marathon training program, we are going to look at the [Hal Higdon advanced Marathon 1](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/advanced-1-marathon) for our example.

 If you scroll down the page here, you will see the way he has set up your weekly running. On Thursdays he has speedwork. In week 3 he has 4x800m intervals scheduled. On week 6 this goes to 5x800, and by week 15 it has progressed all the way up to 8x800m intervals. That’s 4 miles of hard efforts. That is going to have a big hit on recovery! If all you are doing is running and training for a marathon, that’s going to be just fine. But you aren’t just interested in running here. You are trying to run, and build strength in the gym. You want to run a marathon and squat 500 pounds. You want to complete an ultramarathon and still be able to rep 315 on the bench the next week. so that volume needs to be reduced. You don’t need to run those intervals slower, you don’t need to change the schedule, just do a fewer total number. Instead of 4x800 in week 3, and 8x800 in week 15, start with half the volume, and see how you adapt and recover. 2x800 thrown into a nice mid-distance run should be easy enough to recover from, and within a few weeks maybe you can build that up to 4-6x800m.

The same reduction in volume of hard efforts works for your lifting as well. Instead of hitting 5 sets of 3 at 85-90+% on your heavy day, maybe you are only hitting 1-2 sets, but you keep the intensity high. Work up to a top set or two, then move on, so that you can get the adaptations brought on by heavy lifting, without all the added fatigue of crushing yourself with set after set after set.

The tradeoff here is obviously that you will progress at both modalities slower. But one step forward on strength and endurance, is better than two steps forward on one, and one step back on the other.

---

The other thing you will notice, is the sheer volume of easy running I am doing. My primary sport now is ultrarunning, and with that, I do not need to do a ton of fast intervals, in fact the interval work I do have included is probably too short for my goals. (it’s a remnant from when I was working on my mile time)

But all those long easy runs build your base, and if you are beginner, they will also help you get faster.

This might be one of my more controversial opinions, but I think doing intervals/speedwork on a low mileage program (<20mpw) is a waste of time for most people that have a strength background, and they would be better served by adding mileage.

---

**So what are we getting at here, what is the point of this post?**

1. You can get pretty good at both running and lifting, but you can't be truly elite at both simultaneously

2. Cardio will help your lifting, and lifting will help your running… up to a point. There ARE diminishing returns, and eventually even a negative response when you get more advanced in each discipline.

3. Try to separate your lifts and runs by as many hours as possible when you do them both on the same day

4. Keep most of your mileage easy

5. Do your hard runs and hard lifts on separate days if possible

6. Do the harder workout first, follow up with the easier (hard run->easy lift, or hard lift->easy run)

7. Increase mileage before worrying about pace.

8. carbs are magical

9. two 10ks will be easier to recover from than a single 20k, but they don't have quite the same training effect, so split up runs when needed, but try to get at least a few runs per week that are longer.

10. finally, this is really unpopular to say these days, as everyone wants to tell you that you can be a runner and be fat/overweight at the same time, but the truth is, losing weight **WILL** help your running if you are overweight, and gaining weight **WILL** help your lifting if you are underweight, being lean at whatever weight you choose will help you perform best at both, so drop that bodyfat%

I could continue this for pages, but it has gone on long enough. So ask questions and I will try to answer them, or call me dumb for writing this ridiculously long post as an old man with ""mid-results""

Is it normal to feel so overwhelmed by free weights programs,350,269,2024-04-22 15:59:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1caeh3j/is_it_normal_to_feel_so_overwhelmed_by_free/,"Hello,

I am doing research to start working out. I have mostly read books by Jeff Nippard, one about diet (body composition) and another called 'Fundamentals, Hypertrophy Program.' The books are great—really accessible and in-depth.

However, now that I am considering the Full Body Program he suggests in his book, I feel completely overwhelmed. Just for week 1, there are so many exercises (at least from the perspective of someone who has never gone to the gym), and by week 5, the program seems to change almost completely.

For example, from weeks 1 to 4, there are 21 different exercises, and then from weeks 5 to 8, the exercises change almost completely again.

It's taking me a ridiculous amount of time to watch the videos about the exercises and take some notes about the execution of the exercises. I will probably not remember most of it when starting.

Now I am hesitating to just use machines and give up on free weights, as the exercises seem quite different, and I don't want to spend that much time learning them to avoid injuries, because right now all this is feeling like a second job. Are programs supposed to have so many different exercises, or is it just to keep people from getting bored? Because I would love to have a repetitive program that doesn’t require new research every week.

It may be a 'me' problem, but is learning 21 different exercises just to start standard?",Fitness

Detailed macro planning while eating out,44,42,2024-04-16 14:54:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1c5i3p0/detailed_macro_planning_while_eating_out/,"Hey guys!  


I hired an online coach on nutrition a few months back and my progress has been immense. Currently, he is giving me macros every 7 days and I aim to stick perfectly to them.  
The biggest problem is when I am traveling (mostly for business) for periods of 5-7 days around Europe and am obliged to eat at a restaurant.

&#x200B;

I aim to stick to my macros at least 90% of the time when traveling, but struggle with this goal. What do you guys do when eating out at restaurants to plan your meals ahead? Do you use some kind of app that can tell you what to eat specifically from a restaurant to meet your macro goal?

Is there an app that does this that you know of?",Fitness

Leg day for cyclists: higher rep range/other exercises?,29,24,2024-04-05 12:36:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1bwgxoh/leg_day_for_cyclists_higher_rep_rangeother/,"I could use some advice on a leg day routine for my cycling goals. Currently, I focus on hypertrophy while also aiming to prevent injuries and enhance muscular endurance for sprint cycling. 

My typical leg day includes exercises like Romanian deadlifts, Bulgarian split squats (glute-focused), sissy squats, and hamstring curls. If I have extra time, I throw in single-leg RDLs, and cossack squats or side lunges to address balance and target the glute medius.

Since I cycle a lot, and a past injury caused by muscular imbalance (specifically quad dominance/weak glutes, but also weaker left leg), I'm wondering if my leg day should differ from a purely hypertrophy-focused plan.

My main objectives remain hypertrophy, injury prevention, and muscular endurance. Since sprint cycling is kind of a high rep exercise, would incorporating higher reps, possibly up to 25 or 30, be beneficial for improving muscular endurance? Or would I still benefit from low/med rep ranges (5 to 10)?
Advice on exercises of my current routine is also welcome.

Any insights or suggestions on rep range and other lifts/exercises would be greatly appreciated!",Fitness

Totally out of breath from squats and deadlifts,252,197,2024-04-04 18:30:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1bvuqz9/totally_out_of_breath_from_squats_and_deadlifts/,"Hey everyone,

I maybe have a problem with these both exercises. I don't know if this is normal. Maybe it is.

I like to do heavy compound movements. But when I do them, my muscles are not my limiting factor. It is my breath. I am totally gased out after half the reps I want to do.

At the moment I am doing squats with 8 reps. Usually I am 90% out of breath after 4 repetitions and I am not even close to some kind of failure. Same with Deadlifts where I usually do 6 reps.

What I am doing most of the time when doing squats is the following: Do 4 reps, rest in standing position for maybe 5 deep breaths, do 2 reps more, take 5 deep breaths again, do one rep, take 5-8 deep breaths, and then do the last rep.

When I am doing it like this I get close to failure after the 8th rep. I am 100% out of breath after the last rep and probably everyone in the gym can hear me gasping for breath and I breathe heavy for maybe 2 minutes and still not rested at 3 minutes.

Is this normal? Should you do squats like this? With deadlifts the same problem. Pullups und chestpress is 100% okay and no problem here.

I do a lot of medium intensity cardio (cycling) and I don't have problem with endurance, generally.

If this is not normal, what is the best advice? I tried different rep ranges and the problem is present on most rep ranges unless I go super low to 1-3 reps with heavy weight.",Fitness

My name is Joe Gray, I'm one of the moderators at r/HomeGym and when I'm not scheduling AMAs, posting Targeted Talks, and doing fun stuff there, I'm probably coordinating the Garage Gym Competition (GGC).

  
We've been doing this for 7 years! 7 years of the most fun you’ll have lifting, guaranteed… or your money back!

  
The biggest and baddest virtual powerlifting meet has had over 5000 lifters, more than $100k in prizes, millions of pounds hoisted in pursuit of PRs, over $12k in Non-Profit donations… and much much more. All free, YOU just gotta lift.

  
You are the glue that brings it all together.

  
If you don’t lift, we don’t donate. If you don’t lift, the sponsors don’t give away prizes. If you don’t lift, I get bored and start doing weird stuff with my time.

  
So it is on you at this point. Mark your calendars, get lifting, and I’ll see you in May for the big show!

How should my performance in the gym change while cutting?,93,86,2024-03-27 00:17:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1bonybn/how_should_my_performance_in_the_gym_change_while/,"Hello all, I’ve been bulking consistently for about 3 months and have definitely gained some weight. Some fat for sure as well (family roasted me). I’m planning on going on a short 3-4 week cut as I have a wedding coming up. I’m genuinely also curious as to if I have gained muscle. Now I know eating in calorie deficit with higher protein and less carbs is probably ideal when it comes to diet but how would I go about this when it comes to gym performance? Do I keep trying to increase the weight or reps each session? Should I try to change up workouts? Or should I do less weight more reps? Also should I start incorporating cardio into my routine? Any help on cutting in general would be greatly appreciated.",Fitness
Five Years Without a Rest Day,683,251,2024-03-26 15:50:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1bob6rg/five_years_without_a_rest_day/,"Hello, /u/gzcl here with another post about training without rest days. I recently crossed the five-year mark of training without rest days, so I figured it warranted an update.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/12lgk9f/four_years_without_a_rest_day/) is the update from last year. Many other details about my training, including videos of PR lifts, can be found in my post history, Instagram, YouTube, and blog. Each is linked throughout this post.

Before we get into the post, I want to be clear that I am not saying that everyone should train without rest days, or that nobody needs them, or that I’m better than anyone because I have not taken rest days, or that rest days are inherently useless or bad, or that not taking rest days always produce better results or training like this makes me a hard-core tough guy type. So, please, do not read into this post such contrivances.

Again, this post is not telling you that you absolutely do not need rest days, no matter what. This post is critical of rest days because it has been my experience that rest days are often taken for granted and are therefore abused; something which may inhibit training rather than aid it.

Now, I would like to address some basic facts of who I am and what my situation is. These things will provide insight into why I chose to train without rest days, how I am able to do it, and why I am here encouraging you to consider whether rest days are necessary, based on your circumstances, abilities, and goals.

**About me:**  
**Age:** 38  
**Years Training:** 15+  
**Bodyweight:** 205 to 210, daily average. (Up from [158 on day 31](https://www.instagram.com/p/BwItaivA_2-/) of training without rest days)  
**Height:** 5’5”  
**Recent 1-Rep Maxes:** [525 squat](https://www.instagram.com/p/C0KGr8rAkAY/?img_index=1), [340 bench](https://www.instagram.com/p/CuSzsrhgtCx/), [600 deadlift](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4qKfzxAq9K/) (no belt), [250 strict press](https://www.instagram.com/p/Czw7oYDAwKT/?img_index=2). 

All these lifts were performed within the last year of training without rest days. The only lift that is not an all-time PR 1RM is the bench. That is because the bench press messes with my shoulder, a longstanding injury that I am always training around as best as I can; my lifetime 1RM bench PR is 380 pounds. While 635 pounds is my best deadlift, it was with a belt, so the above linked deadlift is a PR of significant variation.

**Training Environment:** Home gym for the first three-ish years of training without rest days, then I opened my own gym. I train at very high elevation (over 10,000 feet) in a well-outfitted commercial facility.

**Health:** No chronic illnesses or diseases. I very rarely get sick. In these five years there was only one time where I had very bad congestion. I still trained. I opted to do a conditioning workout of KB swings and push-ups. It was a great choice at the time because I felt much better the next day. The worst are migraines I get somewhat frequently. When this happens, I will just go lighter or change the plan of the day to doing arms, as those workouts are less stressful in general. If I am even feeling a bit under the weather, I train with reduced volume, intensity, or both, depending on the day and my assessment of where I am then standing recovery wise.

**Injuries:** No serious recent injuries, mostly just training around or in consideration of preexisting injuries (sustained before training without rest days). This has limited the frequency of very heavy lifting, so I’ve opted for more of a volume, and therefore, lighter weight approach in general. That said, I’ve still hit 1RM personal records in these five years. I’m just not lifting heavy each week because when I do I increase my chances of aggravating an old injury.

**Drug Use:** No, I am not using steroids, testosterone, SARMS, or other such chemicals, peptides, hormones, etc. I do have low test and nearly a decade ago I tried TRT for a year. It did not help me. I do not claim to be a “lifetime natural.” These five years of training without rest days was not benefitted by using such performance enhancements.

**Diet:** Whatever my wife makes, or wherever we go out to eat (which is mostly Mexican food). I do not adhere to a strict diet. I eat a lot of breakfast burritos which have plenty of eggs and meat. Most of my diet is based around red meat, especially dinner. Lately, my household has been having a lot of hot pot, which is a copious amount of thin sliced meat, golden radishes, various noodles, and rice cakes. For the last five years I have been rotating different lengths of bulk and cut cycles. I have gained about 50 pounds in this period.

**Supplements:** I try to take creatine and vitamin D consistently. Sometimes I miss days. Same goes for electrolytes. I may incorporate other supplements from time to time, such as fish oil, but have found much of that to have no clear benefit to performance. Not that I doubt those things. It just isn’t a priority for me.

**Sleep:** Average around 6 to 8 hours per night. Sometimes I get less, as I do suffer from sleepless nights occasionally. These may be just 2 to 4 hours of sleep. Still in such cases I will train, adjusting the goal of the session as needed. I do try to have a relatively strict bedtime.

**Why do I train daily?**

1. To see if I can.
2. [Because I enjoy the process](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2023/04/physicality-creativity-and-consciousness.html) (despite some torturous individual sessions).
3. It improves my mood and general outlook on life while at the same time [improving my quality of life by making everyday tasks easier](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/10/1300-days-process-is-goal.html) (shoveling snow in particular) by limiting the impact of old injuries.
4. It keeps my efforts in the gym better regulated so that I do not go overboard in a single session (“because tomorrow is a rest day”) and risk injuring myself, as I’ve done many times in the past when I was taking rest days.

**What does my training look like?**

The overwhelming majority of my workouts are based on my [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) training framework. You can read more about programs and constructing workouts with GG on [my blog](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/). A very detailed description of GG and a progression constructed from that framework can be read in my blog “[General Gainz Body Building](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/general-gainz-body-building.html).” Searching “General Gainz” on reddit will provide many reviews as well as examples of programs others have created with the framework or adapted existing programs to their needs and goals.

In a nutshell, nearly all my workouts are based around using weights. When on vacation I’ve had to do a few bodyweight workouts. Those would typically be done for reps against the clock, so a conditioning session. That said, I estimate that 99% of my workouts these last five years used weights of some kind (bars, dumbbells, kettlebells, cables). Most of my workouts in these five years have consisted of adding reps until I reach a determined volume threshold, then adding weight (this is called accumulation). By training in this way I have managed to set many rep max PR’s. This is especially true for the squat because last year PR’d rep maxes from [1RM (525LB) to 100RM (135LB)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1953k9l/the_tom_platz_experience_pain_pleasure_and_high/).

None of my workouts these last five years have consisted of only doing stretching or yoga, or going for a walk, hike, cardio only, or other such activities. I do not call shoveling snow a workout, nor chopping wood. As I live at over 10,000 feet elevation, my winters have plenty of those things which I just call “living.” Some days I’ll shovel snow for a few hours, then workout. That’s just how it is. In general, my training resembles those common traits of strength and conditioning and/or bodybuilding training.

Because consistency is my primary goal, I am not stuck to a certain split or weekly training schedule. I have a loosely planned schedule and shift days as needed, based on how I assess my recovery. If I planned to squat but my legs are still very sore from a few days before, I will push that a day or two later, instead opting to do something like press. I have found that while I have successfully trained full body for many weeks on end, it does become tiresome, so when it does, I’ll shift to a movement or body part split.

There have been several periods of time in these five years where I have trained the same lift every day for many weeks. I have done this for squat, press, and most recently, the deadlift. Such periods were great for developing those lifts. In each time I was able to reach goals, setting new personal records. Just last week I hit a 600-pound beltless conventional deadlift, a lifetime 1RM PR (the most I’ve ever deadlifted without a belt). That came on the heels of training the deadlift for ten weeks, every day (at submax weights and submax volume). Before testing that 1RM I did take two days off from deadlifting (training shoulders and triceps respectively). For context, in October 2023 I barely completed a [545-pound deadlift](https://www.instagram.com/p/CzJJIFmg7eF/) while wearing a belt (and with the hype of doing that lift at my gym’s deadlift party).

Most of my workouts are an hour or less. If I do a conditioning workout, I try to keep those around 20 to 30 minutes. If you want to see more specific examples of workouts or lifts I’ve done, you can see those on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/thefeverfever/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@GZCL), blog, and previous posts here on reddit.

**The goals of this post are to prove that:**

**1.	Rest days are just another training variable that can be manipulated to benefit training.**

Rest days are like the weight on the bar, the number of reps, total volume, variety of exercises, rest times, lift frequency, and so many other variables when it comes to training. There is no optimal frequency of training that applies to everyone. Likewise, there is no optimal frequency of rest days that applies to everyone. Such is the nature of individual differences. When not taking rest days, other variables need to be adjusted to account for training the next day.

Does this mean you probably cannot train every day to complete exhaustion, taking every lift to absolute failure? Yes. However, because training frequency is higher without rest days, that means skill development can be emphasized. This means greater efficiency and lower risk of injury, thereby improving work capacity and recovery potential. Over time these improve how well you can recover from heavier and/or higher volume workouts. So, as work capacity and skill increases, your ability to perform and recover from tougher workouts more frequently will likewise improve.

**2.	Excluding rest days does not necessarily inhibit progress to either size or strength.**

Before these five years I trained with rest days. I had competed in powerlifting for several years. During that period I won best lifter at a state championship as well as competing several times at the USPA American Cup and the IPL World Championships, often placing first in my weight class. I was decently strong for a lightweight powerlifter who moved up from the 148 class to the 181 class over four years.

I am now bigger than I’ve ever been, both in terms of overall bodyweight and the measurements across my shoulders, chest, legs, and arms. I recently achieved [18” arms](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2TngiMAZ_w/?img_index=1) for the first time in my life; a goal I had set a few years ago. I also set all-time personal records in many lifts, despite not training how powerlifters usually do.

Not only that, but I have trained several clients who also no longer take rest days. Each of them improving their own size and/or strength. So, not only have I grown bigger and stronger without rest days compared to those times when I was taking rest days, I have also witnessed others do the same. I credit this largely to increased training frequency and finally prioritizing more impactful recovery habits (sleep, nutrition, hydration, and de-stressing). When it comes to recovering from training, those practices matter a whole lot more than days of inactivity (AKA “Rest Days”).

**3.	Excluding rest days is a great catalyst for improving training consistency.**

When taking rest days it was easy for me to justify going too hard because “tomorrow is a rest day.” This would frequently result in going too hard, thereby necessitating unaccounted for deloads and rest days (at the time I thought rest days were a make-or-break recovery factor). Such training is akin to two steps forward one step back, and sometimes, many steps back. That kind of regression can be demotivating, which may result in a period of not training at all. While I didn’t have many of those periods, and was consistent before training without rest days, now my training is far more consistent. Not only in terms of frequency, but also in terms of intensity, volume, and effort.

Without rest days I have learned how to better dial in my training, resulting in more effective workouts. Such compounding results add up! Training without rest days is now one step forward, followed by another, and countless others. Because my training is better regulated without rest days, I have not sustained a major injury that resulted in significant setbacks. Lastly, I don’t have to drag myself into the gym anymore. It is now just something I do, and I am nearly every day looking forward to my workout (some workouts I know will be grueling, and I do not look forward to those as much). This is because nearly every workout produces results, albeit small; they are frequent and just as rewarding.

**4.	Excluding rest days can improve training knowledge (knowing how to train).**

Because I am not taking rest days I must account for the other variables when it comes to my training and align those in such a way that both produces results while at the same time allowing for training again tomorrow. This means that I am more aware of my effort, volume, and intensity. Without rest days, learning how to train happens faster, resulting in better progress sooner. I am now better at choosing exercises that benefit me and the way in which I execute those movements. For example, I am no longer benching as often because I feel I should, or simply that it is “in my program, so I must do it.” Rather, I limit that as needed while being more aggressive with other upper body pressing movements.

Similarly, I am better at constructing and executing fruitful workouts, compared to times past, when I would frequently go off plan and do more than needed, at the time believing that pushing myself to complete exhaustion and nearly always taking sets to failure was necessary to progress. That is not the case for me, or anyone. While I do believe that minimal is not optimal, the idea that more is always better is also not true. When it comes to training, as much as you can recover from is best. The only way to know that limit is to train enough to learn what that limit is and the various ways in which that limit can be reached; all while understanding that your limit will increase over time, and when it does, so too must your training.

**5.	Rest days are not the make-or-break factor when it comes to recovering from workouts.**

As I’ve said many times these last five years, the recovery habits that matter most are sleep, nutrition, hydration, and de-stressing. Rest days, meaning days of inactivity, are at best the worst form of recovery. Recovery depends on your work capacity. If you can only do little, you can recover from little. Gradually improving your work capacity through training increases your ability to recover. That process requires the all-important factors of sleep, nutrition, hydration, and limiting non-training related stress, not sedentary days.

Days of inactivity are counterproductive most of the time. Such days would be better spent doing low-impact training like pushing a sled, or cardio, thereby improving your work capacity and therefore your ability to recover from future workouts. If rest days were necessary, then I would not have grown as big and as strong as I have in these last five years. I’ve seen many people online say that not taking rest days produces negative results, guaranteed injury, burnout, and other such undesirable outcomes. The opposite is true, that is, if you learn how to train without rest days, something which necessitates prioritizing genuine recovery habits.

**Common Objections**

In previous posts here on reddit, or as I’ve experienced on social media, people have said a few things about my not taking rest days. Here I will address these common objections and criticisms to training daily.

**1.	“But you cannot train hard” or “You’re not training hard enough” by not taking rest days.**

**Response:** In these last five years I have grown bigger and stronger than I’ve ever been. My training is effective. With it I have achieved many goals. Whether you call it “hard” means nothing in the face of my results. Hard training, while important, is not the harbinger of results. Consistency, effort, and patience are. Daily training bolsters those three all-important factors.

The definition of “training hard” is individually dependent. Some will say that all sets must be taken to failure, or very close, to train hard. Others will say that massive amounts of volume are needed to train hard. Still more will say other things about what it means to train hard; drop sets, limited rest, supersets, no machines, “functional training” only, etc. In every case the assumption is that training hard, every workout, is necessary to progress in the gym. The reality is that our definition of hard is only as hard as we’ve ever pushed ourselves. Your hard may be my easy, or vice versa.

That “training hard” is necessary to progress is a false premise often made by those whose egos are built on how hard they proclaim their training to be. The fact is, my training is as hard as it needs to be, based on the session’s goal and how I determine my recovery to be. I have done many of the hardest workouts of my life in these last five years. But many are not nearly so difficult. Not every session needs to be as tough as the one before it. This truth is obvious when comparing leg workouts to arm workouts. Leg days are a meme for hardship whereas arm days are often believed to be easy – because it is true! Even the hardest arms workout pales in comparison to the hardest legs workout. I will always do an arm workout when I am not feeling well because they are the easiest workouts to do with a high degree of focus, quality effort, reps, and volume.

Training consistency and recovery from that training matters far more than proximity to failure, or the volume of a single session, or other such minutia of which so many overemphasize so that they can deem their training “hard” (and therefore, themselves). For me personally, I find lifting near max weights to be a whole lot harder than doing near max volume. It is tougher for me to recover from. Therefore, I do a lot more volume-based training. Does that mean my training is always easy because I prefer it? I guess in some way, yes. But I do not train so that I can feel hard or say that I do hard things. I train, firstly because I enjoy the process, and secondly, so that I can achieve goals.

Is that process sometimes difficult? Yes. Does progress depend on training always being difficult? No. Sometimes one more rep or one more pound comes easily, and those are just two forms of many kinds of progress to be made in the gym.

**2.	“Training every day doesn’t make you more hard-core” and “Hard-core lifters cannot train daily” (therefore, I am not hard-core, as such accusers themselves identify).**

**Response:** I agree with this. I am not hard-core for training daily. Furthermore, manufactured hardship, as weight training necessarily is, is something I do not see has being inherently or distinctly “hard.” There is nothing “hard-core” about the gym. It is quite a comfortable hobby, even when it is difficult. Even when there is pain, or, paradoxically, discomfort, the act of weight training is safe, nearly always indoors in climate-controlled gyms, with purpose-built equipment, done for self-improvement via sustained incremental progress. It costs money and time. It is firstly, a selfish act. It is, therefore, not a practice through which one experiences genuine hardship and thereby becomes hard themselves. Lifting weights is a luxury, a pleasure, and therefore, not hard-core. I don’t pretend it is and hope more begin to see it my way.

**3.	Training every day is not optimal.**

**Response:** This argument is often paired alongside the idea that training hard is required to progress. Thus, rationally (though incorrect), if training hard then rest days are necessary because if you are not taking rest days then you cannot be training hard. Superficially, this makes sense. However, after a moment of deeper consideration, even the meatiest head will see that it is possible to train hard one way and the next day train something else just as hard. Such is possible when employing any kind of split, whether that be by movement, or body part, or other variables such as volume, intensity, or density.

As touched on in the previous section, sometimes progress comes easily. It has been my experience that with a sensible structure and methodical progression, bolstered by keen autoregulation practices, that adding another rep or putting on five more pounds is less daunting compared to those times when I was always grinding myself into dust trying to eek out every pound, every rep, at every opportunity – at the cost of pain, which I conflated with progress; a common outlook regarding training. Such a mindset about training is based on the fear of missing out (FOMO), which from my experience, produces short lived results, injuries, and dwindling enthusiasm in the gym.

There is no standard of “optimal” that applies to everyone. The most recoverable work is optimal. That depends on the individual. That said, there is truth in the importance of frequency, volume, intensity (meaning load respective of 1RM), and effort. None of those things can be eschewed completely. Each is a variable that must be deliberately adjusted based on the individual’s goals and abilities. The first among those variables is frequency, something which rest days inherently limits. Higher training frequency means more opportunities to reach the limit of recoverable work, which is always the most optimal way to train. Frequency is king among variables (*Mentzer cultists in shambles*).

**4.	 “But you would be bigger and stronger if you were taking rest days.”**

**Response:** Such hackneyed remarks are made by those trying to ignite FOMO within me without considering my training history. For a decade I took rest days and “trained hard” (as I understood it then). I was strong then. But now, I am both bigger and stronger – without taking rest days.

This bromide idea is held by those say, “Rest days produce results, not the training” in one breath and in the next say, “I train harder than you, so I need rest days.” So, which is it? If the first, then training hard does not matter, only the rest days. If the second, then the training matters more than the rest days. The third position is that both matter equally, then necessitating equal rest days to training days, something not seen amongst the biggest and strongest lifters who often promote training up to 6x a week and sometimes multiple times per day.

This statement placates the accuser who themselves has FOMO about their training and their recovery, believing that without rest days they would be missing out on gains. I would bet the opposite because I’ve experienced it myself. Rest days limited my progress because I trained less and my training was less recoverable because I over emphasized the importance of inactivity, placing it above better means of recovery.

Rest days improving recovery is not a guarantee for everyone, because as I said above, rest days are merely another variable. They are not a fixed need and are the lowest tier of importance when it comes to recovering from workouts. Do some people need rest days, yes. Might they see better results without them? Perhaps. That is only knowable if one attempts to train without rest days, adjusting other variables as needed, including prioritizing the more important aspects of recovery (sleep, nutrition, hydration, and de-stressing).

**5.	“The science shows that rest days are needed to progress.”**

**Response:** This is a false claim made by those appealing to an authority which they have no meaningful connection to or understanding of. There is not a single study that unequivocally proves that regardless of how one trains that rest days are required to get bigger and stronger. Such claims are often paired with remarks about “CNS burnout” or “systemic fatigue” which is also false. Lifting weights is remarkably easier to recover from than other activities, in particular running, which people do daily for years on end without objection. How? By adjusting the many variables we have at our disposal to increase our training frequency.

Though some authorities on training may claim rest days are needed, they lack practical experience training without them while at the same time carrying a bias due to their investment in particular methods of training and the brand in which their status rests upon. Might rest days be needed because of the way they train and their recovery habits? Sure. That, however, does not prove that progress cannot be made unless rest days are taken. One such figure is Mike Israetel, PhD., who made a video on this topic, which [I responded to here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAZ85sXNJKQ). Though highly credentialed and regarded in the training community, his take is remarkably bad, irrational, and contradicts his own material.

**Conclusion**

Rest days, commonly practiced as day of low activity or inactivity, encourage doing too much in the gym in a single workout than one can recover from while at the same time limiting training frequency and therefore slow the improvement of work capacity and skill development. That was the case when I was taking rest days during the first decade of my training and I am sure it is for many of you. Therefore, I argue that rest days can inhibit progress rather than help it, as they did my own. As a result of my experience, I encourage you to see if increasing your training frequency (with a likewise increase in your recovery habits; sleep, nutrition, hydration, and de-stressing) will increase your results.

Consider whether rest days are something that inhibits you or benefits you. Are rest days when you backslide, eat poorly, sleep little, and stress over other parts of your life? Are they days you take because you find yourself going too hard in the gym and frequently grinding yourself into the dirt and potentially causing injury? Or might rest days be days you need because you simply do not like training? Think about your rest days and why you take them, and how you can make them better – perhaps including not taking them and training instead. Decreasing days of inactivity might not mean lifting weights more often, but perhaps doing more cardio, or some other form of physical exercise that you enjoy. Training without rest days for you does not have to look how it does for me. Find the appropriate level of activity for you, and should you find that to be lacking, strive to gradually do more.",Fitness

How to push yourself close to failure without ego lifting?,94,141,2024-03-20 02:37:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1bj30nt/how_to_push_yourself_close_to_failure_without_ego/,"So I am kinda new to taking lifting seriously so I chose to get most of my workout plans from google and simply alter them. In one of the articles I was reading it said that as a beginner I should increase my weight/ and or number in set each workout due to  the fast increase in muscle I will have due to being a beginner. While I already expected not to notice anything for a while the lack of change in two months is not concerning however I simply can't keep up with the adding weight aspect. I can lift the weight but I just can't keep good form and go on for that long of sets with those standards. This week I had to save myself twice while lifting (once while on bench and the other whilw squatting) nd I just don't think this is substantial. Any tips to get past this hurdle would be helpful. Also while I am here below are some more niche problems I have been having with the gym that a answer would be helpful.

1. Why am I stuck at a weight? I understand that earlier I started in the post that I don't mind but thoughout 2 months I haven't gained a single pound. Since I was about 14 I have always been very lean, but I feel it has gotten to the point where my body is fighting me actively. To the point where it feels almost unhealthy and unsafe to fight it.

2. How to not feel discouraged after failing a set? Due to lifting alone all I feel are infinite eyes looking at me when I fail a low bench. Due to me always being small the weight I am failing are also small. Due to this I just get up and leave after I fail to close grip bench 2 35's and have to roll the little weight of of me. When this happens I just get up and act like I just finished and leave despite just starting due to dying of embarrassment.

Sorry that this post is unorganized I just left the gym prematurely due to the problem explained in number two and would rather not feel terrible for doing that again. Thank you in advance and have a good day.",Fitness

Howdy!

Unfortunately, it turned out that it was resoundingly *not* just a few weeks until we could reopen with the support of new tools, as I shared back in September. The short, vague version is that bad things happened in my personal life and that takes priority over Reddit shit.

That being said, the last few weeks I've been running extensive tests on the new moderation tools, and have them up and running in a permanent fashion. Barring any unforeseen explosions, the final round of testing will be finished this week and we will be reopening r/Fitness to allow posts again **next Monday, 3/18**.

Before you get *too* excited, keep in mind that this does not mean the sub is going to become a free for all, except on our traditional yearly ""This is why you don't actually want that"" event for April Fool's Day. Posts can be made, but will still be removed if they break [The Rules™](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules), are better suited for the Daily Thread (which will continue on as normal), or at our whims as unpaid jannies that do it for free who require digital oppression to become aroused.",Fitness

"The Tom Platz Experience: Pain, pleasure, and high rep squats",223,60,2024-01-12 19:32:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/1953k9l/the_tom_platz_experience_pain_pleasure_and_high/,"Tom Platz is a retired American professional bodybuilder who was active during the 1970s and 1980s. Platz is renowned for his [impressive leg development](https://broscience.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/tom-platz-leg.png) and is often considered to have the best legs in the history of bodybuilding. Platz's intense training style, often consisting of insanely high rep squats, produced remarkable leg development in an era where many competitors prioritized leg training far less. His legs are iconic, establishing Platz as one of the greatest bodybuilders of all time.

To improve my legs, the squat itself, and most importantly – to see if I could – I figured why not adopt the Platz approach of high rep squatting. It started off by creating [a list of squat sets](https://www.reddit.com/r/weightroom/comments/zq1bkz/comment/j0z0wvs/?context=3) that, once completed, would result in personal records from a 1RM to a 100RM. Some of these sets were records by many reps, others by just a few, and in the case of the 1RM, less than two pounds.

Completing this list of squats was my second priority, next to training daily, which I managed to continue doing. The last squat set from the list that I completed was 185x75, completed in my 1,729th consecutive workout without a rest day.

Each of these sets is a lifetime personal record:

[135x102](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQcDLXm_dm8) (Wanted 100)

[185x76](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6r1Z2P7oKo) (Wanted 75)

[225x51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxlK7QEI2dw) (Wanted 50)

[275x37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Veb-lzEREQM) (Wanted 35)

[500x3](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/MnL0WWsNIV8) (Wanted 3)

[525x1](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hKxWHgnCTLc) Lifetime 1RM PR.

Those sets were not completed in order from lightest to heaviest. Rather, I strategized my progression to work my way through the lighter weight, higher rep sets while also pursuing the heavier weight, lower rep sets. The first set completed was on December 23rd, 2022, as that is my birthday and 225x50 was the closest to my loosely practiced tradition of doing birthday squats (bodyweight x age). I weighed under 200 pounds at that time and then turned 37 years old.

I had 500x2 in mind when first discussing this list. That was later updated to a 3RM because I realized that I had once before squatted 500x2. Also, when discussing the list I did not mention going after a 1RM personal record, as I felt it would be best to keep that one to myself, perhaps because of superstition.

Now knowing the results, and before I get into the how, the why should be explained.

**Why do high rep squats?**

The grueling nature of high rep squatting is a forge of sorts. Surviving it is something worth writing about, evidenced by the many questions people have asked me in the last year. The most common question is why?

There is no scientific reason that makes high rep squats better for size or strength gains. Some, including Platz himself, may object to this. Objections aside, my reason for doing high rep squats was not to merely grow my legs, or to get a stronger squat, though I was sure both would happen. The primary reason I wanted to complete those sets was to see if I could, as each set was daunting. In this way I departed from Tom Platz who used high volume work to excel at his profession of bodybuilding. But for me, the challenge itself was the goal. Did my legs grow? Yes. They are now bigger than ever before. Did my squat get stronger than ever before? Yes. However, each of those things individually could be achieved more easily with a different approach. But it was the approach itself, and the numbers themselves, that motivated me and carried me through the pain of a set to the writhing pleasure of its completion.

The thought of doing 225x50 terrified me. As did 275x35, 365x15, 405x10, and every other set on the list. Perhaps in that way Platz and I now share a thread of kinship. Albeit his weights are far higher than my own. I would like to believe that he also trembled before approaching the squat rack on days where the bar would not be racked until several minutes of squats had passed. Maybe he didn’t. Maybe that’s why he has the greatest legs in the history of bodybuilding. Maybe he was unafraid. Maybe that’s what it takes. Something I don’t have.

Knowing the pain these sets would inflict generated fear. That fear validated the reason why I should train for and complete these high rep squat sets. There is a connection between being afraid of something and how much you value it, or respect it, or recognize its dominion over you. I grew fearful the moment I thought up the list of squats. Immediately I realized that I must complete them, or at the very least try my best. Otherwise the regret of not trying would hurt more than the sets themselves… and the training for them, which hurt worse than almost anything I’ve ever done in the gym. By completing these sets fear would be replaced by joy and I would gain dominion over the squat. The lift that intimidated me most.

I would be remiss if I did not mention having watched on several occasions training videos of Tom Platz, simply to see that he did such things; knowing that what one man can do, another can do. So, I tried to be like Tom, and in the process, I managed to become a faint shadow, a mortal emulation, a blurred reflection, a vestige of the Golden Eagle, a demigod of Bodybuilding. Forever will high rep squats be his ghost, that under the bar, and in such pain, can you be emptied of yourself and possessed by Platz.

**How I trained for high rep squats**

Rather than just take a weight and go to failure week in and week out, I followed a more gradual and structured approach. Because of this, my approach was far less aggressive than what Tom Platz would likely promote. That is fine by me. I merely followed a different path to the same goal: squatting a ton of reps. Perhaps my methodology is the fox’s way while Platz’s the lion’s. If so, I hope the shrewd reader finds the following details helpful. The courageous need not read further, for their hearts need nothing else.

The reason behind my gradual and structured progression was because remaining injury free was at the top of my list. I managed to do exactly that by limiting my exposure to failure. As a result, I was able to train every day (despite some very hard squat workouts), ensuring that I achieved my primary goal: to train daily. And my secondary goal: to PR my squat from 1RM to 100RM.

**General and Specific Conditioning.**

For the last five years I’ve been using my [General Gainz](https://www.reddit.com/r/gzcl/comments/aqkdgo/happy_gday_gainerz/) training framework. This is a flexible and intuitive approach to structuring and progressing workouts. That said, not every workout while training for these high rep sets followed the intensity and volume limits of my General Gainz model. There were many conditioning focused workouts that were done according to more traditional methods of improving work capacity, for both cardiovascular fitness and the specific fitness needed to complete an obscene number of squats.

My conditioning focused workouts were built around Every Minute on the Minute (EMOM), or As Many Rounds (or sets) As Possible (AMRAP), or a certain number of reps and sets completed As Fast As Possible (AFAP). When it comes to conditioning, I had a general component and a specific component. General conditioning is geared towards overall fitness and work capacity, especially aerobic, whereas specific conditioning is aimed at improving the strength and endurance of the legs, particularly the anaerobic pathway. Early in the year I included much more traditional forms of cardio like rowing, stationary biking, and occasionally the treadmill. Later in the year, as my general conditioning had improved enough to get the work done, I shifted my focus towards more specific conditioning workouts that were based on the squat itself.

I also included kettlebell swings and step ups as forms of general conditioning work. Those would help prepare me for more challenging specific conditioning sessions where squatting itself was the main course. When doing general conditioning sessions I would pair rowing with something like sit-ups, leg lifts, other abdominal exercises, and/or pressing of some sort; bench or overhead (as that also served to benefit those lifts as well). An example of these kinds of sessions would be something like a 20-minute AMRAP of 250m row, 10 leg lifts, and 10 kettlebell presses. These would typically be done 1x a week, alternating weeks with a specific conditioning session built around the squat.

The specific conditioning sessions would be something like a 60-minute EMOM of squatting a weight for 3 reps, for example. These kinds of sessions were not always 60-minutes. That is given as the maximum time I would go for in a specific squat conditioning workout. For such a long duration I would typically only be doing singles. This worked great for developing the strength and stamina for weights from 275 to 365. The reason why I like these kinds of approaches (EMOM, AMRAP, AFAP) to conditioning are that they have different variables and therefore motivating factors.

For quick review:

**EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute):** Completing a certain number of reps and exercises each minute, resting in the seconds remaining. Then starting the next set at the next minute. These would often be just a set of squats, but sometimes I would include a set of pull-ups as well.  These are great for maintaining time while scaling up one or two variables: weight and volume. Most often I would keep one the same while increasing the other. Such as doing a 20-minute AMRAP of squatting 275 for 3 reps followed by 3 pull-ups. The next time I completed that workout I would try to put on more weight, doing the same number of reps with squats, or vice versa (same weight but adding a rep); for the sake of moving fast with pull-ups I would keep those at bodyweight and just add a rep. Never did I add weight to pull ups. Though for some that is a viable option. 

**AMRAP (As Many Rounds (or Reps) As Possible:** This has a fixed time limit, much like the EMOM, however the amount of work completed and the amount of rest is variable. Like with the EMOM example, the variables of weight and volume would increase as the workouts were completed. These conditioning workouts were the toughest because I knew I had to go for a certain amount of time while also limiting the rest as much as possible so that I could complete as much work as possible. The hardest workout I did last year was a 20-minute AMRAP of squats, performing as many sets of 5 reps with 135 pounds as I could. [Forty-four sets later](https://youtu.be/05U-51I92pk?si=5Zhgsg4f9R_HocPB) I was a squirming heap on the floor in the squat rack. That is likely the hardest workout I’ve ever done. I’ll never do it again. It was among the most painful experiences of my life. I do not recommend you try it. 

**AFAP (As Fast As Possible):** This has a fixed work component (number of exercises, reps, and sets) with the overall time being the variable. Therefore, much like the AMRAP the rest is also variable. These were great because I knew I could reasonably estimate how fast I could get something done, then determine the number of exercises, reps per set, and the number of sets. For a general conditioning session I may do something like 10 rounds of kettlebell swings, push-ups, and sit-ups, moving as fast as I can through the work. For a specific conditioning session it would be something like 20 sets of 2 reps squats. These were great when I had a busy schedule and a limited amount of time to train, and/or I knew I was under recovered and couldn’t do too much, but still needing to train. Using this kind of conditioning approach I could limit the volume and intensity, pushing myself by limiting rest. Therefore, these kind of conditioning workouts were great when I needed to get work done while also favoring recovery, considering how much fatigue I had accumulated, and what I needed to do to benefit my conditioning (if even just marginally). 

**Volume Progression**

Here’s where my General Gainz (GG) training framework came into play. Using GG, one can work through RM progressions by adding weight (intensification) or adding volume to the same weight (accumulation). Because the squat set list consisted of weights I could already lift at the start of 2023 (except for 455, 500, and 525). I chose a weight for a heavier day and a weight for a separate lighter day, trying to push those for more reps each week (accumulation). A third day of the week often consisted of squatting too, then built around the previously mentioned conditioning workouts.

Over the course of the year I was able to push weights I could already lift, gradually earning more reps, in the process building up the ability of squatting those heavier weights I could not yet lift. When I started this set list, I could not squat 455 for one rep. By the time I finished the set list I squatted that weight for five and now live with the pain of regret not going for a sixth.

**A (very brief) summary of General Gainz**

The GG framework progresses your lifts by providing four actions to take that move you through a range of RMs.

**Find:** When you find a new weight at an RM. Like adding 10-pounds to your previous 5RM. You’ve found a new weight for an RM you had previously done.

**Hold:** Using the same weight or trying for the same amount of volume (RM+ follow-up sets), or the same amount of rest between sets. You’re holding a variable (weight, volume, rest) consistent from week to week while attempting to progress one or more other variables.

**Push:** Using a known weight and trying to lift it for more reps. Like making your 5RM weight last week a 6RM this week. Likewise, adding reps to the follow-up sets that are completed after the RM. For example, doing sets of three reps after the RM if last week you were doing sets of two reps. Rest can also be pushed lower by decreasing the period between sets.

**Extend:** Doing more sets after the RM. All sets after the RM should be at the same weight as the RM. If four sets were completed after the RM last week, extending to five or six sets may be the best option this week. Similarly, rest could be extended by increasing the period between sets.

Using those four actions (find, hold, push, extend), I would progress through the First Tier (T1) and Second Tier (T2), by finding an RM at a weight, then trying to push and/or extend the follow-up volume for the next several weeks. Over the course of several weeks, the follow-up volume would accumulate to the point that I could push the RM further, closer to my goal. Once I had achieved the RM goal, I would move on to the next weight.

Since the set list has weights that go up in 45’s and 25’s, I only used those weights. I did not use weights between those increments, as I felt that I could push a weight to its target RM, and in the process that prepared me to lift the next weight. At no point in time did I use percentages or small weight increases to prepare me for the next weight on the list. I would lift it, find its initial RM, then over the course of several weeks push that weight to its RM goal.

**The T1 and T2 structure for GG is as follows:** (Updated since the inception of GG five years ago.)

**T1:** 3RM or less, then performing the same weight for singles after the RM. The goal for the follow-up set volume is to match the RM via singles, with an extension limit of 3 additional singles beyond the RM. For example, if a 3RM was completed the goal is 3 follow-up singles. The maximum would be 6 singles after the 3RM. All the volume is at the same weight.

**T2:** 4RM to 10RM. After the RM, perform additional sets of reps at half the volume of the RM. For example, doing 2 rep sets after a 4RM, or sets of 3 reps after a 6RM, or sets of 5 reps after a 10RM. If an odd number RM was completed at a moderate or easy effort, then I would round up, such as doing sets of 5 after an easy 9RM. The minimum goal for follow-up volume was 4 sets (thereby doubling the RM value) with an extension limit of 6 sets after the RM.

Once the volume limit was reached by extending the singles (T1) or the half-sets (T2) to their respective limits I would then try to push the RM higher. There’s a bit more nuance and more options to this, which is further detailed in the example progression below, as well as many of my blog posts. Perhaps the most helpful is [General Gainz Body Building](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2022/01/general-gainz-body-building.html).

**T1 and T2 Bridge Weights:** These are the 4RM, 5RM, and 6RM. After these, singles or half-sets could be completed, depending on the effort of the RM. For example, doing doubles after a hard 4RM would be quite taxing and therefore limit the total volume possible. Perhaps just two or three sets of two reps. Also, the rep quality would deteriorate faster. Therefore, after a hard bridge weight RM, opt for singles, or in the case of the 5RM and 6RM, you may go for doubles, thereby opening the “effort gap” (the difference in reps from the RM to the follow-up reps per set; singles after a 6RM have an effort gap of 5 reps, for example, making the singles easier individually, allowing for more high-quality volume). Minding the effort gap in these bridge weight RMs helps keep rep quality high, rest low, and in the process allow that weight to cross the bridge from T1 to T2 by adding volume through the push and extend actions.

Over the course of many weeks a 3RM becomes a 4RM with singles after, then a 5RM followed by doubles, then a 6RM followed by triples, and eventually a 10RM followed by sets of 5 reps. Such is the essence of how I completed the high-rep squat set listed at the start of this post. By adding volume to the follow-up work, I built my ability to push the RM, which then promoted still more follow-up volume. In so doing I was able to achieve the squat set list. Because I did it, so can you.

**T3's:** Typically done within a given rep range, from 10 to 12 per set, or 12 to 15, or 15 to 20 for example. Alternatively, these can also be completed for a certain total amount of reps within three to four sets. Such as aiming for 40 total reps in 3 sets, or 60 total reps in 4 sets. Once that rep total was reached, the weight would be increased.

**Example Workout**

The below workout is an example of a lighter session. This session would typically be on Fridays. Monday would have heavier T1, T2, and T3 exercises.

\[Movement, Rep Max, Weight, Effort, Reps Per Follow-Up Set, Number of Follow-Up Sets\]

Squat: 10RM@315(E) +5 reps x 4 to 6 sets

Lat Pull Down: 12 to 15 reps at a moderate to hard effort x3 to 4 sets

Leg Press: 12 to 15 reps at a moderate to hard effort x3 to 4 sets

Quadriceps Extension: 12 to 15 reps at a moderate to hard effort x3 to 4 sets

Hamstring Curl: 12 to 15 reps at a moderate to hard effort x3 to 4 sets

GHD Sit-Ups: 12 to 15 reps at a moderate to hard effort x3 to 4 sets

**Example Weekly Schedule**

Monday: T1 squat + heavier back and leg accessories

Tuesday: T1 press (or bench) + heavy triceps accessories

Wednesday: Conditioning (either general or specific, depending on the week and the block)

Thursday: T2 press (or bench) + heavy shoulder accessories

Friday: T2 squat + lighter back, ab, and leg accessories

Saturday: T2 press (or bench) + lighter shoulder and triceps accessories

Sunday: Biceps (I’m trying to get 18” arms and this was the only day I could put sufficient time and energy towards training these directly. It is working.)

**Example Progression**

You can find a very detailed example progression in my recent blog [**Kill the Bear**](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2023/12/1700-days-kill-bear.html) which provides some insight to the psychological concepts that I used to help me push for more reps, enduring more pain than before, so that I could achieve the squat set list. What pleasure came from completing a set from that list! As soon as it was done, it was as if every muscle fiber in my body rejoiced.

The example progression describes an accumulation phase. This is a period in your training where volume progression is the priority. In GG, this is done by extending the follow-up sets, which build the capacity need to push the RM.

The above linked blog is an example strategy of how to push 365 pounds from a 6RM to a 15RM (about where I started with 365 pounds when I thought up the set list). Doing so more than doubles the volume one is capable of with a weight. This is essentially how I completed every set from the list. I would start with the weight and keep using that weight until I had pushed it to the RM goal. For example, I took 405 from a 5RM to a 10RM. Likewise, I took a 1RM@455 to a 5RM. That built me up for a 1RM@500, which soon became a 3RM@500 and a new lifetime PR.

Let my example guide your efforts. I applied these same concepts and similar progression patterns to all the RM goals. The methodical approach detailed in the linked blog is how I achieved every squat set I determined to do last year. Take those concepts and apply them to your weights, abilities, and the movement of your choice. When going for very high rep sets, I widened the range for the RM and its follow-up sets while still using the GG ratios. For example, a 25RM followed by set of 12 or 13 reps (the logical extension of the T2 volume range).

The blog's example progression, being in the T2, would take place on Fridays. Its progression does not list assistance or accessory exercises. Its purpose is to provide a look at how volume progression works with GG using the main lift. Truthfully, once squatting a 15RM+8x6 afterwards I had little energy left to go hard on accessories, so those were kept lighter, per the example schedule above.

**Conclusion**

For me, the grueling challenge of high rep squats transcends the realm of mere physical exertion. High rep squatting involves not only physical strain but also a mental and emotional metamorphosis. The absence of a scientific rationale for their superiority in size or strength gains defies conventional wisdom, for the effort is not best suited for either. Rationally, the lifter prioritizing the theoretical “optimal” would not choose to do high rep squats. The allure and value of high rep squats are in the challenge itself. The Tom Platz experience unfolds as a personal odyssey, where each high rep set becomes a quest for self-discovery and conquest.

The intrinsic value of high rep squats is in the formidable nature of each set, with fear serving as the catalyst that validates the significance of the endeavor. That fear manifests as a driving force behind the pursuit of completing the reps. Before long, fear of the sets and the pain they bring, uncover a greater fear: wondering if I could do something but choosing not to because it would be hard. Then opting for comfort so long as I could tolerate the unique pain that ease bears.

This experience produced an imaginary kinship with the legendary Tom Platz, despite our vast differences in ability. That he suffered before me was encouraging. What Tom could do, so could I. The nature of high rep squats reflects the universal human experience of foreboding before a daunting task. Though we may never know, I suppose that even the greats have experienced a moment of uncertainty and fear before such sets, underlining the innate transformative power of high rep squats. Speaking for myself, I know this to be true. Perhaps you too will experience the same.

In the end, performing high rep squats is not just a conquest over physical pain but a triumph over the symptoms of fear itself. Workouts progress from initial intimidation to a realization that training is not about the destination, but [the transformation undergone in the process](https://swoleateveryheight.blogspot.com/2023/04/physicality-creativity-and-consciousness.html). Each rep becomes a testament to the indomitable spirit that emerges when one is emptied of self and possessed by the pursuit. High rep squats are where fear yields to joy, and the cries of a new creation whisper the adage that “what one man can do, another can do.”",Fitness
